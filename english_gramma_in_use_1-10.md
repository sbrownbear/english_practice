## Unit 1. Present continuous (I am doing)

Sarah is in her car. She is on her way to work. She’s driving to work.

Please don’t make so much noise. I’m trying to work.

Where’s Mark? He’s having a shower.

Let’s go out now. It isn’t raining any more.

Hi, Jane. Are you enjoying the party?

What’s all that noise? What’s going on? 

I’m reading a really good book at the moment. It’s about a man who…

Kate wants to work in Italy, so she’s learning Italian.

Some friends of mine are building their own house. They hope to finish it next summer.

You’re working hard today. Yes, I have a lot to do.

The company I work for isn’t doing so well this year.

Is your English getting better?

The population of the world is increasing very fast.

At first I didn’t like my job, but I’m beginning to enjoy it now.

I’m cooking Christmas dinner right now.

I’m working in an amusement park now, but it’s only for summer.

It’s autumn. The weather is becoming colder day after day.

### Practice 1

This is Sarah. Look, she is driving her car. A couple of days ago her car almost hit an old lady while she was driving and talking on the phone with her friend Claire.

Sarah is feeling stressed these days because of the accident. The old lady wasn’t hurt, but she had to go to hospital. Sarah is getting really upset with the fact that she nearly killed a person just because of a stupid device. So, now she’s visiting the old lady in hospital.

The number of drivers and devices is increasing faster. Thanks God, the companies are improving useful technologies, so Sarah can buy a hands-free device to talk to Claire. But as the prices are also growing Sarah considers that it is cheaper to have a face-to-face talk.
