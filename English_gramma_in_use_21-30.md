Hi there. I’ve just talked to Sarah. She says Jack’s going to pass his driving test on Friday. He’s already changed his Facebook status to: ‘Don’t call me on Friday at eight thirty, I’m passing my driving test’. I wonder how many of his friends will read it.

I hope he won’t have any problems with the test, though there’s always a chance that something will go wrong. Actually, it happened with him twice. That’s why he hasn’t got his driving license yet.

Yesterday, we were sitting at Sarah’s. Sarah was looking through the news feed. I remember Sarah saying something about going out. But I couldn’t go, I was beat. I was so done with my studies that I apparently dozed off. It could have been that Sarah and Jack decided to leave me alone and went out silently. 
When I woke up, I felt my cell phone vibrating. It was Jack. He was gasping saying he couldn’t find Sarah anywhere. He said they were both hanging out on the stand-up show when suddenly people heard a gunshot in the club.

I thought he was pulling my leg, though he could have come up with a better joke. But he wasn’t joking. Sarah was gone. They split up some time before the shot and when panic started, Jack couldn’t find her in the crowd. All I could do was contacting all our friends and acquaintances asking any up-to-date information about Sarah. If you saw her anywhere, let me know ASAP.

### Практика 28

Claire got an e-mail from Otto, her cousin.

Hi, Claire! How are you doing?

Paul and I are thinking of living along, as we are almost 20. But we don’t know how our parents will take it. Your folks must have missed you a lot when you left.

Now, the books. You must have bought the old versions of Hoffman’s books that haven’t been adopted. You must read the brothers’ Grimm books then. And believe me, in the original it’s a lot better. It could be tough here and there, but much more fascinating. I know you can do it, as you can speak German pretty well. You’re just too lazy. You must have never read the original versions of such well-known fairy-tales as The Snow White and Cinderella.

I’ve read your massage about Sarah on your Facebook page. Is it true that Sarah is missing? I can’t believe it. The police must be doing everything possible. Tell Jack that he must be strong.
Stay in touch. Otto. 

## Unit 29. May and might.

Where’s Bob? He may be in the office. He might be having lunch. Ask Ann. She might know

It may be true. Or It might be true. She might know. Or She may know.

Sarah couldn’t have got my message. Otherwise she would have replied.

I wonder why Sarah hasn’t replied to my message. I suppose she might not have got it. 

## Unit 30. Might and may.

I haven’t decided yet where to go for my holidays. I may go to Ireland.

Take an umbrella with you. It might rain later.

The bus isn’t always on time. We might have to wait a few minutes.

Liz may not go out tonight. She isn’t feeling well.

I’ll be late this evening (for sure) I may/might be late this evening (possible)

### Практика 30

What are you doing tomorrow, Clark? – I don’t know. I might stay with my girl.

I think Tony and Angela might be having an affair.

You might as well go sightseeing since you’re in our city already.

Otto’s letter for Claire.

Hi Claire. Our parents are still hesitating about where we might go on vacation. We could go to America and we might as well stay in Europe. We’ll see. If we go to America, we might be visiting you in July.
What happened to Sarah really sucks, but don’t sweat it. You’re right, she has her own life. She might have decided she needed an urgent vacation or something. She might have met her old friend and they might be having the time of their lives right now. Or she got really drunk that night and she might be suffering from the worst hangover?

All I’m trying to say is don’t be so worried. And tell Jack not to be an alarmist. Here in Germany many young people after 20 do whatever they want. They might tell no one about their plans, ever their parents and closest friend. So, no panic.
