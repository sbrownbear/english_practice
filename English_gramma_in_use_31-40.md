## Unit 31. Modals: Have to. Отличия Must and have to. Должен и обязан

You can’t turn right here. You have to turn left.

I have to wear glasses for reading.

George can’t come out with us this evening. He has to work late.

Last week Tina broke her arm and had to go to the hospital.

I haven’t had to go to the doctor for ages.

What do I have to do to get a new driving licence?

Karen doesn’t have to work on Saturdays.

Why did you have to leave early?

If the pain gets worse, you’ll have to go to the doctor.

I might have to work late tomorrow evening.

It’s later than I thought. I must go.

I haven’t spoken to Sue for ages. I must phone her.

Mark is a really nice person. You must meet him.

I have to work from 8:30 to 5:30 every day.

Jane has to travel a lot for her work.

Applications for the job must be received by 18 May.

You must write your answers in ink.

We had to leave early.

## Unit 32. Modals. Must, mustn’t, needn’t

Don’t tell anybody what I said. You must keep it a secret.

We haven’t got much time. We must hurry.

You must keep it a secret. You mustn’t tell anybody else

We must be very quiet. We mustn’t make any noise.

You can come with me if you like, but you needn’t come if you don’t want to.

We’ve got plenty of time. We needn’t hurry.

We needn’t hurry = We don’t need to hurry.

I think it’s going to rain. I’ll take the umbrella. I needn’t have brought the umbrella. Paul had to go out. 

He thought it was going to rain, so he took the umbrella. But it didn’t rain, so the umbrella wasn’t 
necessary. So he needn’t have taken it.

Everything will be OK. You needn’t worry. 

Everything was OK. You needn’t have worried.

I didn’t need to get up early, so I didn’t.

I didn’t need to get up early, but it was a lovely morning, so I did.

I got up very early because I had to get ready to go away. But it fact it didn’t take me long to get ready.

So, I needn’t have got up so early. I could have stayed in bed longer. Я встал очень рано, потому что мне 
нужно было готовиться к отъезду. Но на самом деле мне не потребовалось много времени, чтобы подготовиться. Так что мне незачем было вставать так рано. Я мог бы остаться в постели дольше.

### Практика.

You must do – ты должен сделать

You mustn’t do – нельзя этого делать (запрещено или нежелательно) 

You needn’t do (You don’t need to do) = You don’t have to do – не нужно этого делать (но если хочешь, можешь сделать)

You needn’t have done – не нужно было этого делать (но ты сделал), прошлое

You didn’t need to do it – не было необходимости это делать

You don’t need to pay for the internet, I’ve already paid

I didn’t need to take my son home from the nursery. My husband did it.

I needn’t have waited in a line to get the tickets. It turned out I could have booked them online.

When I entered Jack and Sarah’s apartment yesterday, I realized at once that there was a lot of work someone needed to do there. I thought I didn’t need to bother about Jack, but now I see that I do. Cigarette smoke was everywhere. Jack looked miserable sitting by his old PC and scrolling comments under the post on Sarah’s missing. I guess he needn’t have spent so much time on a computer. Counting empty coffee cups, I also thought that he needn’t have drunk so much coffee.

The kitchen was in a mess. The fridge needed to be loaded. The dishes needed to be washed. Jack himself needed to have some rest. He asked if I had heard the news: the gunman appeared to be Thomas Jackson, a forty-year-old former student from our school. I looked into Jack’s red eyes and I got this strong feeling that I couldn’t leave him and stay with him that night.

## Unit 33. Modals. Should.

You look tired. You should go to bed.

The government should do more to reduce crime.

Should we invite Susan to the party? Yes, I think we should.

I think the government should do more to reduce crime

I don’t think you should work so hard.

Do you think I should apply for this job? Yes, I think you should.

You shouldn’t believe everything you read in the newspapers.

You should apologize. You must apologize. You have to apologize

I wonder where Tina is. She should be here by now.

The price on this packet is wrong. It should be 2.50 not 3.50

That man on the motorbike should be wearing a helmet.

She’s been studying hard for the exam, so she should pass

There are plenty of hotels in the town. It shouldn’t be difficult to find somewhere to stay.

You missed a great party last night. You should have come. Why didn’t you?

I wonder why they’re so late. They should have arrived long ago.

I’m feeling sick. I shouldn’t have eaten so much.

She shouldn’t have been listening to our conversation. It was private.

You look tired. You should go to bed now.

You went to bed very late last night. You should have gone to bed earlier.

### Практика

…I should never have let your lips leave mine all those years ago in Boston. I should never have pulled away. I should never have panicked. I should never have wasted all those years without you. Give me a chance to make them up to you. I love you, Rosie, and I want to be with you…

…Мне не следовало отпускать твои губы от моих много лет назад в Бостоне. Я никогда не должен был отстраняться. Я никогда не должен был паниковать. Я не должен был тратить впустую все те годы без тебя. Дайте мне шанс наверстать упущенное. Я люблю тебя, Рози, и хочу быть с тобой…

Oh, don’t worry, guys. Nothing happened, if you mean ‘it’.

Jack and I are just friends, though we have become closer than ever these days. Sitting at the living room and watching Jack torturing himself, at first I thought that I shouldn’t have come at all. But people should support each other in difficult situations, so I stayed.

He suggested we should watch a movie. I agreed under the condition that it would have nothing to do with Netflix. He started laughing.

We watched Mary Poppins. Honestly, guys, it’s such a warm stuff. That’s the movie you should definitely keep in mind when you need to take a load off. I suddenly found myself in Jack’s arms feeling warm and comfortable. We were cuddling (like good supporting friends, of course). But at that moment if felt so right. I have never felt better in my entire life even under the circumstances. But what should I do about it now?

- I’ve lost my watch. Have you seen it anywhere?

- No, but if I found it, I’d tell you.

What would you do if you won a million pounds?

If I got fired, it would be impossible for me to earn enough money for a new car.

### Практика 38

Hi guys. I’m in a strange mood today. It might be called “If ifs and ands were pots and pans” I’m sure you know what I mean.

If I had more money, I would eat healthier food and I wouldn’t get overweight.

If I had a boyfriend, I would be happier and would be more motivated to keep fit.

If I had a better job, I would be far richer than I am now.

But the thing is there is no possibility to check it out.

Maybe if there were a chance, I would prefer getting lost instead of Sarah. But would it be better?

I know that if I keep thinking like that, I will get very depressed. So, I’d better pull myself together and continue doing something useful like learning German.

## Unit 39 If I knew. I wish.

He would read more, if he had more time.

If I didn’t want to go to the party, I wouldn’t go.

Я хотел бы изменить мир? Хотел бы я иметь сверхспособности, как у волшебника или супергероя.

### Практика

Do you want to know what I’m thinking about? ‘Wish’ is probably my favorite word. It somehow reminds me of my childhood and magic.

I remember I wanted to have the magic lamp like Aladdin. I still wish I had it. I’m sure lots of people think to themselves “I wish I had a lamp like Aladdin or a fairy godmother like Cinderella. I wish I had magic powers to solve all my problems.”

Speaking of wishes, not many people really know what they want. I’m sure you wish you had more money. But do you actually know what you are going to do with it?

Every girl dreams: “I wish I met my Price Charming”. But she is apparently not ready to share a bathroom with him.

That’s a big problem for all of us. We wish someone would solve our problems. And we always wish more than we can actually handle.
