### Практика

The police say that the building was set on fire.

My request was applied and now it’s being considered.

Her son will be drafted into the army in autumn.

Do you remember my dream about Sarah? Well, Sarah definitely wasn’t tortured or beaten. Her only health problem was a hangover. And I guess she is suffering from some mental problems, because she got back together with Jerome. I can’t believe she has forgotten how many times she was betrayed by him. But she loved him so much and after they broke up she couldn’t get over him for months.

What can I tell you about Jerome? Well, he is very handsome and hot, he always wears elegant suits, his hair and beard are always taken care of. But the guy is a jerk! He loves only himself, a typical narcissist.
We were worried about Sarah all those weeks and she didn’t even bother writing a short message.

Poor Jack. When he saw Jarome, his face turned red. I barely stopped Jack from tearing Jerome into pieces. All I could do was push Jack out. I brought him to my place. We were driving in silence, not a word was said on the way home. Jack was devastated. He told me he was tired and went to sleep at once.

3. He got drunk last week. He decided to drive home by himself. He got into an accident. He got injured, but luckily no one else was hurt. Now he is obliged to pay a huge fine.

Hi guys. I’m sure you’re dying to know what happened next. So now you know that me and Jack are living together. But not as a couple. Remember he had nowhere to go after he saw Sarah and Jerome in his apartment. He was so deeply offended and depressed that I felt sorry for him. And I was stupid enough to suggest him staying in my place as long as he needed. So, he stayed. We discussed at once that we are roommates, and insisted on paying the half of the rent.

But now I’m not so sure that he is just a roommate for me. I mean it’s so unusual to live with a man. And I guess I’m getting attracted to him. It’s not even a problem that he was born one year later that me. Who knows, maybe eventually it will go away. We’ll see.

Yesterday Jack was late home. He usually calls. But he didn’t and it’s not like him. I was getting really worried when I finally got a phone call from prison. 

Claire, help me out. I have been taken to the police station arrested on suspicion of terrorism.

While having breakfast, Jack asked me why I was so sad. He obviously noticed that something was disturbing me. I lied that there was nothing to worry about and tried to change the subject. I asked him, why he wasn’t at work, but he answered that it was Sunday and he doesn’t work at Sundays. He kept questioning why I was so blue if everything was fine. I gave up and told him about Surah’s e-mail. He was confused and quickly change the subject in return. It was obvious that he didn’t have any intention to discuss Sarah. He asked me if I had any plans for that day. I answered it was nothing special. He said it would be stupid to turn that evening into a lousy one. So, we decided to go out.
